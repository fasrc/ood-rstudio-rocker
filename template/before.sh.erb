# This script (`before.sh.erb`) is sourced directly into the main Bash script
# that is run when the batch job starts up. It is called before the `script.sh`
# is forked off into a separate process.
#
# There are some helpful Bash functions that are made available to this script
# that encapsulate commonly used routines when initializing a web server:
#
#   - find_port
#       Find available port in range [$1..$2]
#       Default: 2000 65535
#
# We **MUST** supply the following environment variables in this
# `before.sh.erb` script so that a user can connect back to the web server when
# it is running (case-sensitive variable names):
#
#   - $port
#       The port that the web server is listening on
#
# The functions find_port and create_passwd are defined within /opt/ood/.
# See https://discourse.openondemand.org/t/where-are-batch-connect-helper-functions-defined/1005/2


# site-specific: may need to change port range
# Find available port to run server on
port=$(find_port ${host} 7000 11000 )

export SINGULARITYENV_USER=${USER}

# Define a password and export it for RStudio authentication
password="$(create_passwd 16)"
export SINGULARITYENV_PASSWORD="${password}"
